## **How to Use**  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mongodb-query-practice.git
   ```

2. **Set Up MongoDB**:  
   Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud-based solution or install it locally.

3. **Import the Dataset**:  
   Import the `dataset.json` file into your MongoDB database to get started with the queries. You can use the MongoDB shell or MongoDB Compass to import the dataset.

   ```bash
   mongoimport --db your-database-name --collection books --file dataset.json --jsonArray
   ```

4. **Practice Queries**:  
   Open `questions.md` and start solving the queries using the MongoDB shell, Compass, or any other MongoDB client. After you've attempted the queries, check `answers.md` for solutions.

## **Practice Queries**  

In `questions.md`, you will find a list of practice queries that cover a wide range of topics in MongoDB, including:

- **Basic Queries**: Retrieve data, filter results, and select specific fields.
- **Intermediate Queries**: Use operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, `$in`, etc.
- **Advanced Queries**: Complex queries using operators like `$elemMatch`, `$nor`, and `$all`.
- **Update Operations**: Use `$set`, `$push`, `$pull`, and `$inc` to modify documents.
- **Delete Operations**: Remove documents based on various conditions.
- **Aggregation Queries**: Use the aggregation pipeline to perform data transformation and analysis.
